# Friend Stalker

A university assignment for a web service-oriented web app.

  - The frontend uses KnockoutJS, AMD and Bootstrap (the requirement was jQuery UI - managed to negotiate)
  - The backend runs on DynamoDB and JAX-RS
  - The proposed name was "Friend Finder", but no one other than obsessive significant others would use such a service
